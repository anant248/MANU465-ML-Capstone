# MANU 465 Project - Proposal

** to delete **
Please upload a 1-2 page project proposal, clearly state motivation for choosing this project, the goal in this project (what you wish to achieve), a brief plan and steps to complete this project, and the potential ML algorithm you think, you may use. Suppose you are writing this proposal for a company that asks you to do a data analyses & ML project for them; so you need to show them clearly what is your approach and plan to successfully complete this project. (Only the project's Liaison needs to submit.)
