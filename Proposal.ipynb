    "Please upload a 1-2 page project proposal, clearly state motivation for choosing this project, the goal in this project (what you wish to achieve), a brief plan and steps to complete this project, and the potential ML algorithm you think, you may use. Suppose you are writing this proposal for a company that asks you to do a data analyses & ML project for them; so you need to show them clearly what is your approach and plan to successfully complete this project.

    "If the only features used in the model were the absolute and relative brainwaves, it is our intuition that classification models such as **SVC**, **Kernel SVC**, or **Logistic Regression** could be used to succesfully train the model. However, since data for the gyroscope, accelerometer, jaw clenching, and blinking is available. We believe that a deep-learning neural network (NN) such as **ANN** or **CNN** would leverage these features alongside the absolute and relative brainwaves to achieve better performance than other classification models."
